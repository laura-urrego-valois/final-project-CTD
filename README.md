# Final Project of Certified Tech Developer career

## Project Description:
The MVP Digital Booking Vive la Aventura project is a website that offers the possibility to book tours and activities in different countries, providing users with the opportunity to experience exciting and enriching adventures. The website focuses on promoting adventure tourism and providing an easy and convenient platform for users to find and book their preferred activities.

Users can browse the website and filter options based on destination, date, activity type, and other relevant criteria. Each activity has its own detailed page with information about duration, difficulty level, prerequisites, and price. Additionally, users can view ratings from other travelers who have participated in the specific activity.

Once users find an activity that interests them, they can make a reservation through the website. The booking process is easy and secure, and users can select their desired dates and provide the necessary details to complete the transaction.
